Choose any US presidential election from the 21st century. Use the 'Range of Possibility' slider to control how much the simulationâ€™s results could vary (the higher you set the slider to, the more outrageous the results may be). Use the 'Skew Dem(-)/Rep(+)' slider to skew the election toward either major candidate. Hit 'Run' and watch as the simulator generates a new election outcome, state by state! Observe the state-by-state results and the hand-crafted map.
